# HTML-Project from Ground Zero Level

Hey there, welcome to our HTML open source project. Redesign the HTML landing page, learn and have fun doing it. Happy coding :)

**Please note: We do not assign issues to contributors. If you see a bug or if there is a change you want to make, do not open a new issue. Simply follow the instructions below and submit your changes by opening a pull request.**

# Contribution Guide

- Fork the repository, create a clone and make sure that you are not working on the `MASTER BRANCH' repository!

```bash
git clone https://github.com/{your-github-username-here}/HTML-project.git
```

```bash
cd HTML-project
```

- It is not good practice to work on the `master` branch. You can create a new branch by using this command

```bash
git checkout -b {name-of-the-branch-here}
```

- Add a stream so you can sync your clone with the original repository (get the latest updates)

```bash
git remote add upstream https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/HTML-project.git
```

- Use this command to stay up to date with the original repository (not the fork that you made)

```bash
git pull upstream master
```

- Make your contribution too :)

- Open a Pull Request also.
